# compiler : 

## Advantages:

Compiled programs generally run faster because the entire code is translated into machine code before execution, allowing for optimizations. They can also be packaged as executable files, making them easier to distribute. 

## Disadvantages:

Compilers can be slower to develop with because errors are reported after the entire code is processed. They also may offer less portability than interpreted languages. 

# Interpreters:

## Advantages:

Interpreted languages are generally easier to develop with because errors are reported as they occur, making debugging easier. Interpreted languages also tend to be more portable. 

## Disadvantages:

Interpreted programs typically run slower than compiled programs because the code is translated line by line during execution. They also do not allow for the same level of optimization as compilers.
